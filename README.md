# Spider_Australia
A Scrapy program that scraps teams from the AFL wikipedia , and ready to be forked and expanded 

##How to use
Assume Scrapy has installed, inside this repository, do

    scrapy crawl AFL-wiki -o afl.json
Then you should be abe to see a json file with the name of "afl.json" 
The json files consisted of 
- Name of the football club 
- URL for the football club
- URL for the logo of the club
- I forgot seriously I don't have the file here now...

##Issues
I don't know how to find players information, anyone had an API for that for me?
